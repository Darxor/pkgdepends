* `fulltarget`: absolute path to the downloaded file. At most one of
  `fulltarget` and `fulltarget_tree` must exist on the disk.
* `fulltarget_tree`: absolute path to a package tree directory. At most
  one of `fulltarget` and `fulltarget_tree` must exist on the disk.
* `download_status`: `"Had"` or `"Got"`, depending on whether the file
   was obtained from the cache.
* `download_error`: error object for failed downloads.
* `file_size`: Size of the file, or `NA`. For `installed::` refs, it is
  `NA`, and it is also `NA` for refs that created `fulltarget_tree`
  instead of `fulltarget`.

`fulltarget`, if it exists, contains a packaged (via `R CMD build`)
source R package. If `fulltarget_tree` exists, it is a package tree
directory, that still needs an `R CMD build` call.
