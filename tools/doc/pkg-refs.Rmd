```{r include = FALSE}
options(
  pkg.show_progress = FALSE,
  cli.unicode = FALSE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  cache = TRUE
)
```

The currently supported reference types are:

- `cran`: a CRAN package.
- `bioc`: A Bioconductor package.
- `standard`: a package from CRAN or Bioconductor.
- `github`: A package from GitHub.
- `local`: A local package file or directory.
- `installed` An installed package.
- `deps` The dependencies of a local package file or directory.

If a ref does not explicitly specify a type, then the following rules
are applied:

- if the ref is a valid `standard` ref type (without the `standard::`
  prefix), then `standard` is used;
- if the ref is a valid `github` ref type (without the `github::` prefix),
  then `github` is used;
- if the ref is a GitHub URL, then `github` is used;
- otherwise an error is thrown.

## CRAN packages:

A package from CRAN. Full syntax:

```
[cran::]<package>[@[>=]<version> | current | last]
```

- `<package>` is a valid package name.
- `<version>` is either a package version, or 

Examples:
```
forecast
forecast@8.8
forecast@>=8.8
cran::forecast
forecast@last
forecast@current
```

Note: pkgdepends currently parses the version specification part
(everything after `@`), but does not use it.

## Bioconductor packages:

A package from Bioconductor. The syntax is the same as for CRAN packages,
except of the prefix of course:

```
[bioc::]<package>[@[>=]<version> | current | last]
```

## Standard packages:

These are packages either from CRAN or Bioconductor, the full syntax
is the same as for CRAN packages, except for the prefix:

```
[standard::]<package>[@[>=]<version> | current | last]
```

## GitHub packages:

Packages from a GitHub repository. Full syntax:

```
[<package>=][github::]<username>/<repository>[/<subdir>][<detail>]
```

- `<package>` is the name of the package. If this is missing, then
  the name of the repository is used.
- `<username>` is a GitHub username or organization name.
- `<repository>` is the name of the repository.
- `<subdir>` optional subdirectory, if the package is within a
  subdirectory in the repository.
- `<detail>` specifies a certain version of the package, see below.

`<detail>` may specify:

- a git branch, tag or (prefix of) a commit sha: `@<commitish>`;
- a pull request: `#<pull-request>`; or
- the latest release: `@*release`.

Examples:
```
r-lib/crayon
github::r-lib/crayon
r-lib/crayon@84be6207
r-lib/crayon@branch
r-lib/crayon#41
r-lib/crayon@release
```

For convenience GitHub HTTP URLs can also be used to specify a
package from GitHub. Examples:

```
https://github.com/r-lib/withr
# A branch:
https://github.com/r-lib/withr/tree/ghactions
# A tag:
https://github.com/r-lib/withr/tree/v2.1.1
# A commit:
https://github.com/r-lib/withr/commit/8fbcb548e316
# A pull request:
https://github.com/r-lib/withr/pull/76
# A release:
https://github.com/r-lib/withr/releases/tag/v2.1.0
```

A GitHub remote string can also be used instead of an URL, for example:
`git@github.com:r-lib/pkgdepends.git`

## Local packages:

A path that refers to a package file built with `R CMD build`, or a
directory that contains a package. Full syntax:

```
local::<path>
````

Examples:
```
local::/foo/bar/package_1.0.0.tar.gz
local::/foo/bar/pkg
local::.
```

## Installed packages:

This is usually used internally, but can also be used directly.
Full syntax:

```
installed::<path>/<package>
```

- `<path>` is the library the package is installed to.
- `<package>` is the package name.

Example:
```
installed::~/R/3.6/crayon
```

## Package dependencies:

Usually used internally, it specifies the dependencies of a local
package. It can be used to download or install the dependencies of a
package, without downloading or installing the package itself.
Full syntax:

```
deps::<path>
```

Examples:
```
deps::/foo/bar/package_1.0.0.tar.gz
deps::/foo/bar/pkg
deps::.
```
